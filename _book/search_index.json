Hobbes, Lock and Rousseau: civil society is a social contract between a strong society and relatively weak state Hegel and Marx: civil society is a product of capitalism Tocqueville: civil society is in opposition to the state and the key to successful democracy Liberal-individualist model a way for governments to minimize their own direct involvement in the areas of social welfare and development and to open up those arenas to the entrepreneurial spirit of private initiative empower and organize individual citizens so that they can constrain state power Habermas: public sphere 2.5.3 The Privatization Perspective This perspective sees the rise of NGOs as one part of a larger shift towards a neoliberal governmentality, where the state shifts its responsibilities to its citizens onto the private sector NGO: private, non-transparent agencies A growing NGO sector may be seen as part of a larger trend of privatization in China that disempowers citizens rather than facilitating Tocquevillian democracy privatization can be a strategy that allows the state to maintain control even while decreasing its own costs and responsibilities. 相反 In China, in the last decade, increased NGO involvement has gone hand-in-hand with increased state investment. Far from allowing the state to retreat from its responsibilities, Chinese NGOs seem to have the opposite effect. 2.6 Institutional Interdependence 2.6.1 The Organizational Approach Both the civil society framework and the privatization perspective are based on Western political theories which assume division between state and society, and which seek to determine the current status of the zero-sum game between those two entities. In constructing their strategies, organizational actors will tend to replicate their own institutional experiences and the strategies commonly used by other organizations in their field. Their strategies will also tend to fit the cultural frameworks extant in their society build relationships of institutional interdependence with state agencies 2.6.2 Turning to the State for Resources Although none of the Chinese NGOs I studied relied primarily on state sources for direct funding, all of their leaders insisted that cultivating good relationships with state agencies was the key strategy for securing organizational resources because of the state’s capacity to permit or constrain access to even non-state resources The Chinese state also controls NGO access to beneficiaries 2.6.3 The Constraint of Institutional Experience organizational strategies are shaped not only by exter- nal circumstances, but also by the institutional experiences of their members The founders and employees of the first generation of Chinese NGOs had a great deal of institutional experience working with and through party-state agencies, but almost no experience working with non-state sources, such as private donors, foreign charities, or foundations 2.6.4 Ideology and Cultural Frameworks Organizations are not only shaped by the need for resources and constrained by the institutional competencies of their members, but also influenced by cultural considerations. Cultural frameworks shape organizations in a number of ways. narratives ability to attract actors In the PRC, the prevailing cultural framework for making sense of social welfare organizations assumes that the state is primarily responsible for taking care of its citizens. 2.6.5 State Agencies as Organizations Like all organizations, state agencies need to secure a constant stream of resources to remain viable. Like all organizations, state agencies are shaped by the institutional experiences of their members and are influenced by the cultural frameworks of their society. Resources: government downsizing state agencies can gain legitimacy and be protected from downsizing if they can claim to be serving important social welfare needs. Once provided with this type of justification, they know how to obtain resources through the state bureaucracy. Chinese NGOs can help meet these organizational needs by, first, drawing public attention to social welfare problems which require state intervention and, second, providing tested solutions which state agencies can then implement From an organizational standpoint, both Chinese NGOs and state agencies can benefit from partnerships with one another. 2.7 The Counterexample of Chinese NGOs Founded by Westerners 2.8 Concluding Thoughts 2.9 Comments 简介三句话是全文的精华：1）NGO有兴趣和政府合作；2）NGO和政府各有其局限性；3）合作是互利的 作者用了resource, institutional experience和cultural framework来解释这种合作。 NGO GOV Resource 政府不直接提供，但影响很大 政府需要NGO支持，才能向上证明社会需求，为抵制downsizing提供合法性 Institutional Experience 中国人主要有和政府打交道的经验 ？ Cultural Framework 在中国，政府被视为社会问题的解决者 ？ 对NGO的解释还行，对政府其实只用resource中的legitimacy做了解释 剩余几个问题 Gov的legitimacy是典型的「央地关系」视角，state-society视角可能要聚焦NGO能完成政府做不到的事儿 GOV是否有institutional experience的局限？（i.e 习惯领导一切） 引入NGO的竞争关系能否让这个文章更精彩？ https://www.colgate.edu/about/directory/chsu↩︎ "]
